[INSTRUCTIONS]
-Click the direction buttons to move character. No keyboard support.
-When in a tough spot, type the name of a fruit in your inventory
 to consume it!

The goal of this game is to rack up as many levels of experience
as possible before dying by the evil hands of the skeleton, ever
increasing in power. 
You may pick up fruit that will aid you in your quest. However,
these are randomly generated, so you might end up with nothing
but potatoes, yikes!

[AVAILABLE FRUIT]
Potato = +4HP
Apple  = +6HP
Banana = +8HP
Grapes = +10HP
?????? = +??HP

Try killing the skeleton until a certain item drops.. It has a
5% drop rate. You will have to find out for yourself! It's worth
it. Otherwise, killing the skeleton has a 15% chance of dropping
a regular fruit!

[KNOWN BUGS]
-The skeleton cannot move. It uh.. lost its legs. Not enough calcium.
 Yeah that's it. What do you mean the programmer couldn't make the AI
 work and made up an excuse to cover it? Nonsense! Moving on..
-The skeleton can appear on top of fruit. Who said skeletons don't
eat food too? Get to them before him!
-First steps of the game are slow. It might take a bit for your
 computer to be able to handle such an action-packed game. Don't worry!
-There is a very slight chance for the skeleton to start on top of you..
 Don't panic, he can smell fear. Try moving away and it should be fine.

Thank you for playing my Roguelike game.
